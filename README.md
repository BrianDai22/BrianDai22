My name is Brian Dai and I'm currently a student attending NYU Stern studying Business and Computer Science in CAS. I started learning Java around the beginning of 8th grade. During my learning journey there were a lot of ups and downs, but I'm here now using Java as my primary language with fluency in C++, HTML, JSS, etc. Currently, I am working on side projects to up my technical skills/knowledge.
