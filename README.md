My name is Brian Dai and I'm currently a student attending Great Neck South High School. I started learning Java at a relativley young age of 8 years old. During my learning journey there were a lot of ups and downs, but I'm here now at the USACO Silver level using Java as my language. Currently, I am planning on making a switch to the faster and harder to learn language C++ to expand my knowledge and speed.
